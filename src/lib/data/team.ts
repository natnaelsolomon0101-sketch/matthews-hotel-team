    bio: `Luke leads Matthews' Texas hospitality capital markets practice, advising owners, developers, and institutional sponsors on full-service and lifestyle hotel transactions across the Sun Belt. Over fifteen years he has closed more than $2.4 billion in hospitality investment sales and debt placement, with a sweet spot in branded full-service assets between $20M and $150M.

Before joining Matthews, Luke spent eight years on the hospitality investment sales desk of a national platform, where he led the firm's Texas resort and lifestyle practice. His current pipeline includes call-for-offers assignments in Austin, San Antonio, and the Hill Country, as well as recapitalization mandates for repeat institutional sponsors.

Luke sources roughly half of his transactions through repeat client relationships and the rest through Matthews' national investor reach.`,
