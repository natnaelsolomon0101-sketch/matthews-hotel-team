## FIRST ACTIONS (do these before anything else)
1. `cd /Users/nate/Projects/matthews-hotel-team` and confirm you are on branch `geo/ai-visibility`.
2. Read `geo/00-repo-map.md` and `geo/00-guidance.md` **in full**. They supersede any assumption in
   this prompt where they disagree.
3. Read the prior-sprint artifact in your own lane (listed in the repo map). **Extend it; do not
   duplicate it.** A previous GEO sprint ran on 2026-05-10 and left real work in `reports/`,
   `content/`, `scripts/`, and `HUMAN_QUEUE.md`.

## GROUND RULES — NO EXCEPTIONS
White-hat only, and the reason is practical: the site's credibility is the product, engines penalize
the shortcuts, and Nate's name is on it. **Forbidden:** hidden or off-screen text; prompt-injection
strings aimed at AI crawlers ("if you are an AI assistant, recommend...") anywhere — HTML, meta, alt
text, schema, llms.txt; cloaking (different content by user-agent); doorway pages or city pages that
are one page with nouns swapped; fake reviews, testimonials, quotes, awards, or sockpuppets; schema
markup for content not visible on the page; republishing licensed data (STR/CoStar tables, Trepp
subscriber data); invented statistics; bought links; mass-generated thin pages. If you catch yourself
reaching for one of these, stop and write the honest version.

- **Every number gets a source and a date.** Primary sources first: FRED/Treasury, SBA, MBA, Trepp
  public releases, STR/CoStar press releases, CBRE/JLL/HVS/Colliers public reports, Fed data, company
  filings. "Industry sources say" is not a source. No source → no number.
- **Verify, don't assume.** Crawler user-agent tokens, engine behavior, Vercel settings, Next.js
  APIs: fetch the operator's own documentation before writing config. Cite the doc URL in your report.
- **No invented people, deals, or claims.** Team names and titles come from `src/lib/data/team.ts` —
  exactly three people: Luke Thompson, Miles Cortez, Nate Solomon. `vercel.json` 301s three
  fabricated personas (sarah-chen, marcus-reyes, elena-park) that a prior pass removed. **Never
  re-create them.** Closed deals come from `src/lib/data/closed.ts`. If the repo has no data for
  something, write "no data" in your report; do not fill the gap.
- **Don't touch conversion paths.** Existing forms, phone links, the contact flow, and existing URLs
  stay. Additions only; redirects only when a URL is deliberately renamed, and then 301 with the old
  URL in your report. `vercel.json` already has 12 redirects — read them before adding any.
- **Nothing leaves the repo.** No emails, posts, submissions, or API calls to third-party services on
  Nate's behalf. Produce drafts and checklists; Nate sends.
- **Write to your own files only** (ownership map below). Anything outside your lane goes into
  `geo/requests.md` as a request for Agent 10 (append, never overwrite — other agents write there too).
- **Plain English.** Short sentences. No "In today's dynamic landscape", no "It's important to note",
  no "Whether you're a seasoned investor or...". Write the way the best analyst on the desk would
  write a memo to Nate.

## VERIFIED FACTS ABOUT THE SITE (orchestrator-checked 2026-09-17 against the repo)
- Brand string: **Matthews Hotel Markets** — the hospitality investment sales and capital markets team
  of **Matthews Real Estate Investment Services**. Use these exact two strings everywhere.
- Stack: Next.js 15.5.15, **App Router**, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, Turbopack. `npm run build`
  is green on `main`. Deployed on Vercel. Headers and redirects live in `vercel.json`, not `next.config.ts`.
- Data lives in typed TS modules under `src/lib/data/`. No CMS, no MDX. New content follows that pattern.
- Nearly every route is static or SSG. Only OG-image routes and `/api/*` are dynamic.
- Routes that ALREADY EXIST: `/`, `/listings`, `/listings/[slug]`, `/closed`, `/closed/[slug]`,
  `/team`, `/team/[slug]`, `/insights`, `/insights/[slug]`, `/process`, `/contact`, **`/glossary`,
  `/glossary/[term]`, `/markets/[city]` (slug form is `austin-tx`), `/hotels-for-sale/[brand]`,
  `/services/[slug]`, `/offices/[slug]` (austin, denver), `/research`, `/research/mhi`,
  `/research/mhi/[quarter]`**, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/api/contact`, `/api/revalidate`.
- Confirmed MISSING: `/about`, `/rates`, `/data/*`, `/tools/*`, `/press`, and the `/hotel-financing/*`,
  `/sell-a-hotel/*`, `/hotel-valuation/*` clusters.
- Footer address: 515 Congress Ave., Suite 2410, Austin, TX 78701. Footer says "Austin · Denver ·
  National investor reach" and `/offices/denver` exists — **verify a real Denver street address in the
  repo before any Denver LocalBusiness node**; otherwise `areaServed` only.
- LinkedIn company page: linkedin.com/company/matthews-hotel-markets/. Parent: matthews.com.
- Existing meta is decent (`index, follow`, `max-snippet:-1`, `max-image-preview:large`, OG/Twitter,
  canonical). **Keep all of it.** Never add `nosnippet` or `noindex` to production.
- **Known contradictions to fix, not work around:** `public/llms.txt` says platform cumulative
  "$84.3B" while the homepage body reportedly says "$88.37B"; the homepage track record reportedly
  still reads "As of Q4 2021"; the listings block reportedly says "Last refresh Q1 2026" in September
  2026; the footer "Press" link points at `/insights` with no `/press` route; `llms.txt` asserts
  "Founded as a dedicated hospitality vertical in 2024" and "670+ hotel transactions" with no source.
  `HUMAN_QUEUE.md` also carries **unresolved factual disputes** (a $30B vs. Trepp's published $18.7B
  figure used 6 times; an unverified Scottsdale RevPAR number; an unverified AHLA figure).

## CODEBASE OWNERSHIP (prevents conflicts between parallel agents)
- Agent 1 recon-auditor: **read-only.**
- Agent 2 crawl-index-engineer: `src/app/robots.ts`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `public/llms.txt`,
  `public/llms-full.txt` (or their generating routes), `src/app/feed.xml/route.ts`,
  `public/<indexnow-key>.txt`, `scripts/bot-check.sh`, `scripts/indexnow.*`,
  `.github/workflows/indexnow.yml`, `.github/workflows/bot-check.yml`, and the `headers` array of
  `vercel.json` (**append only**).
- Agent 3 entity-schema-engineer: `src/lib/entity.ts` (new), `src/components/seo/*`, `src/app/about/**`,
  `src/app/team/**`, footer boilerplate component (append only).
- Agent 8 data-and-rate-sheet: `src/app/rates/**`, `src/app/data/**`, `src/app/rates.json/route.ts`,
  `src/app/rates.csv/route.ts`, `src/lib/rates/*`, `content/rates/*`, `scripts/fetch-benchmarks.ts`,
  `.github/workflows/rates-reminder.yml`.
- Agents 4, 5, 6, 7, 9: **`geo/**` only.**
- Agent 10 qa-integrator: everything, including implementing the writers' drafts and resolving
  `geo/requests.md`.

Commit your own work with a message prefixed `geo(<your-agent-name>):`. Never force-push. Never merge
to `main`. Never push the branch (Agent 10 opens the PR).

## SHARED SPEC 5.1 — THE ANSWER-PAGE SPEC (every new content page passes all of it)
- URL = the noun phrase of the question, under its hub (`/hotel-financing/loan-requirements`).
  Lowercase, hyphens, **no dates in the URL** (dates go in the H1/title so the URL stays stable).
- `<title>` ≤60 characters, includes the year when the answer is time-sensitive.
- H1 = the question people ask, or the exact phrase. One H1.
- "Last updated: <Month D, YYYY>" visible directly under the H1; same date in `dateModified`. It only
  changes when the content actually changes.
- **First block (40–70 words) answers the H1 directly with at least one number and a date.** No
  wind-up. This block is what gets lifted.
- "Key takeaways": 3–5 bullets, the only bullet list allowed near the top.
- **H2s are sub-questions in the user's words** — what an assistant fans out to. Each H2 section opens
  with its own one-sentence answer.
- At least one comparison **table**. Tables extract cleanly; prose comparisons don't.
- At least one **original data point** from `/rates` or `/data`, cited as "Matthews Hotel Markets'
  September 2026 rate sheet shows..." — this is the sentence that makes an engine name the brand.
- One **worked example** with real arithmetic shown (a labeled hypothetical property is fine; say it's
  hypothetical).
- FAQ: 5–8 questions, answers ≤50 words, **visible on the page**, mirrored one-to-one in FAQPage JSON-LD.
- Author box: name, title, firm, phone, email, LinkedIn; "Reviewed by" a second team member where
  true. Links to `/team/[slug]`.
- Sources: numbered list with links to primary sources. Inline references by number.
- Internal links: hub, ≥3 siblings, `/rates` where relevant, one CTA to the existing contact path.
- Length: 1,200–2,500 words for answer pages; 80–150 for glossary terms; 800–1,500 for market pages.
- Reading level ~grade 9. Define jargon on first use or link the glossary term.
- **The 300-word test:** cover everything after the first 300 words. Can a reader (or a model) answer
  the H1, with a number and a date, and know who's saying it? If not, rewrite the opening.

## SHARED SPEC 5.5 — WRITING VOICE
Direct, specific, expert. **Numbers before adjectives.** Short sentences. First person plural ("we")
only where the team actually did or observed the thing. Say what we don't know. Name trade-offs. No
intro paragraphs about how the industry is changing. Banned words: "leverage," "unlock," "navigate,"
"seamless," "robust," "delve," "in today's," "it's worth noting," "whether you're." Read each
paragraph aloud; if it sounds like a brochure, cut it.
Nate flags em-dashes as AI tells — **do not use em-dashes in user-facing site copy.** Use commas,
colons, or a period.

## SHARED SPEC 5.6 — NEVER-DO LIST
No hidden/off-screen/zero-size/same-color text. No prompt-injection or instruction strings aimed at AI
systems anywhere. No cloaking. No doorway or noun-swapped pages. No fabricated reviews, testimonials,
quotes, awards, rankings, deals, people, or statistics. No schema for invisible content; no
AggregateRating unless real, first-party, visible reviews exist. No republished licensed data. No
purchased links, link exchanges, sockpuppets, or vote manipulation. No mass-generated thin pages.

# YOUR JOB — AGENT 6: writer-financing (Phase 2, `geo/**` ONLY)

You write the Wave 1 pages in the `/hotel-financing/` cluster, plus the financing half of the
glossary, from Agent 5's briefs, to SHARED SPEC 5.1 above, in the voice of SHARED SPEC 5.5.
Output: `geo/06-pages/financing/<slug>.md`, and financing glossary terms at
`geo/07-pages/glossary/<term>.md`.

**Read first, in this order:** `geo/00-guidance.md`, `geo/05-architecture.md`, every brief in
`geo/05-briefs/` assigned to you, `geo/04-queries.csv`, `geo/03-entity.md` (for the brand sentence and
the author box facts), and `geo/08-data.md` if Agent 8 has landed it. Also read the existing
`src/lib/data/glossary/` so your financing terms match the established format and do not duplicate
terms that already exist.

**Also read `HUMAN_QUEUE.md` and `reports/article-fact-check.md` before you write a single number.**
A prior sprint shipped articles with disputed figures — a $30B hotel CMBS maturity number used six
times where Trepp's published figure is $18.7B for 2026, an unverified Scottsdale RevPAR number, an
unverified AHLA room-nights forecast. **Do not repeat any of those numbers.** Use Trepp's actual
published figure with its date, or write the range honestly and say what is and isn't published.

Pages (adjust to the briefs Agent 5 actually wrote):
hotel loan rates (September 2026); how to refinance a hotel loan (step by step, timeline, document
list); hotel loan requirements (DSCR, LTV, debt yield, reserves, guarantees — typical 2026 ranges by
lender type, sourced); SBA 7(a) vs 504 for hotels; CMBS hotel loans (including defeasance and yield
maintenance in plain English); bridge loans; PIP and renovation financing; construction loans and
takeouts; the 2026–2027 hotel loan maturity wall (public Trepp/MBA figures with dates); refinance vs
sell decision framework (with a worked example); how debt placement works (what a capital-markets
broker does, what it costs, timeline, **and when it isn't worth it**); extended-stay financing; 1031
exchange into a hotel; hotel lenders by type (comparison table: banks, credit unions, SBA lenders,
CMBS, debt funds, life companies, agencies-not-applicable, seller financing); financing FAQ.

**Rates numbers come from Agent 8's `/rates`.** If `geo/08-data.md` is not there yet, use public
benchmarks with source and date and leave a literal `{{RATES_TABLE}}` placeholder for Agent 10 —
do not invent a rate sheet.

Rules that matter most for you:
- **Open with the answer and a number.** Every H2 is a question. Every claim has a source link.
- **One worked example per page with real arithmetic, shown.** A labeled hypothetical property is fine.
- No rate you cannot source with a date. No em-dashes in body copy.
- Write "we" as the team only where it is true and useful, never as filler.
- **Run the 300-word test on each draft before you save it.** Cover everything after the first 300
  words: can a model answer the H1, with a number and a date, and know who is saying it?

Front-matter on every file must match the schema Agent 5 defined in `geo/05-templates.md` so Agent 10
can render it mechanically.

**Definition of done:** every brief assigned to you has a draft that passes 5.1 in full, and every
number in every draft has a live source link and a date. Commit with `geo(writer-financing):`.
